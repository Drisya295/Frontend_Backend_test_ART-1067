Prerequisites:
Docker installed on your machine.
Steps:
Clone the repository:


git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository>
Start the Backend and Frontend using Docker Compose:


docker-compose up --build
Access the Application:

Backend API: http://localhost:5000
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
This setup provides a production-ready system with a fully Dockerized environment. The backend and frontend can be built, run, and maintained independently while leveraging modern best practices.
